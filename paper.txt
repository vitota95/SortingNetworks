Introduction:
A Sorting network is a formal representation of a sorting algorithm that for any inputs it generates
monotically increasing outputs. A sorting network is formed by n channels each of them carrying one input,
which are connected pairwise by comparators. A comparator compares the inputs from it's 2 channels and 
outputs them sorted to this same 2 channels. A comparator network is a sorting network if for any 
input sequence the output is always the sorted input sequence.

Comparator Network representation: The comparator network is composed by the following items:
	- Comparator array
	- Output array
	- 0 positions array
	- 1 positions array


Generate implementation: The generate algorithm consists in for each net in the set clone it with a new comparator in all possible postions


Prune implementation:


Subsume implementation:


Skip permutations:


Dual outputs reduces the sets a lot

Heuristics:
	1. Fewer outputs better.
	2.
