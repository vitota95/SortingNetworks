# SortingNetworks master thesis
To execute the project first you need to install dotnet. The script [installdotnet.sh] will install .NET5 in a Linux machine. 
You can use the script [run.sh] which will build the project and execute it. You can check the available options in [SortingNetworks/Program.cs]. 
For changing between modes you can comment or uncomment the preprocessor directives, for example in [SortingNetworks/ComparatorNetwork.cs] you can switch
the #Permute directive in case you want to apply the permutations.

The master thesis PDF is found in [paper/main.pdf]
