# SortingNetworks master thesis
To execute the project first you need to install dotnet. The script [installdotnet.sh](https://github.com/vitota95/SortingNetworks/blob/master/installdotnet.sh) will install .NET5 in a Linux machine. 
You can use the script [run.sh](https://github.com/vitota95/SortingNetworks/blob/master/run.sh) which will build the project and execute it. You can check the available options in [Program.cs](https://github.com/vitota95/SortingNetworks/blob/master/SortingNetworks/Program.cs). 
For changing between modes you can comment or uncomment the preprocessor directives, for example in [ComparatorNetwork.cs](https://github.com/vitota95/SortingNetworks/blob/master/SortingNetworks/ComparatorNetwork.cs) you can switch
the #Permute directive in case you want to apply the permutations.

The master thesis PDF is found in [main.pdf](https://github.com/vitota95/SortingNetworks/blob/master/paper/main.pdf)
