	abstract="A sorting network for N items, or an N-sorter, is a circuit with inputs I = {\{}i1, i2, ..., iN{\}} and outputs {\O} = {\{}o1, o2, ..., oN{\}}, such that {\O} is a monotonically increasing permutation of I. Sorting networks can be constructed using ranks of a basic cell called a comparator, which is essentially a 2-sorter. For example, the 4-sorter depicted in Fig. 1 employs five comparators, which all emit their larger input on their higher output lead.",
